|**2B > 5C > 4C > 66 > dl j.C > j.2B > 214A > dl.5B > 2C > 236[A] > 5A > 3C > jBCA > AT** <br> 2B starter allows 2C 236[A]. 5B starter does not. |3545|80|?|Everywhere|❌|
|**2B > 5C > 4C > 66 > dl j.C > j.2B > 214A > 2C > 236[A] > 5A 5B > 623A\~A > jAC > AT** <br> Optimal midscreen route. 623A combo with 236[A] extension. Its very important to hit the 623A\~A very up close to get the jA to connect. If anything looks even slightly off, you have to give up airthrow jumpcancel okizeme and 623A\~A jB(2) superjump jCB(2) AT is a better route choice. There are 4 meaningful levels where it is possible to trade damage for consistency in this route: <br> -  5B 2C 236[A] 5AA 623A\~A jB(1)C AT ... 3587 damage: significant damage loss but very consistent. <br> - 5B 2C 236[A] 2B 623A\~A ... is 3596 damage and very consistent, but has slightly less corner carry than the autocombo route. <br> - 5A 2C 236[A] 5B 623A\~A ... is 3619 damage. The combo after landing 5B is consistent, but the 5B itself requires a well timed 5A to have enough altitude. <br> - 5B 2C 236[A] dl.5A 623A~A ... is 3635 damage and makes the 236[A] 5A link easy but is very prone to arc facing the wrong way at almost every step if anything goes even remotely wrong. |3636|90|?|Everywhere|❌|
