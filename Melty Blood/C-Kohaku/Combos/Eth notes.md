```
start with 5A 2BB 4B 5C~C 236B j[C] 2C
[12:16 AM]
its tricky to link the charge normal after the 236B
[12:16 AM]
so get that down first
[12:17 AM]
basically every combo uses that link
[12:18 AM]
Kohaku has a very annoying learning curve
[12:18 AM]
her 'easy' combos are way harder to get proper knockdowns
[12:18 AM]
so you kinda need to learn the whole long as fuck routes to get consistent knockdowns
[12:18 AM]
and theyre all variable timing based on height and distance
[12:19 AM]
some of her stuff only knocks down reliably at very high combo gravity too
```

```
the actual setups from it are 63214C~X > plant
[12:25 AM]
like you whiff the followup as soon as possible
[12:25 AM]
and then they just get knocked down and you can set up a plant
[12:25 AM]
i dont think its a 'good' setup though
[12:25 AM]
like if you do Bplant they can just jump it and you dont have time to meaty to jail
[12:25 AM]
I think A Plant is meaty, but A plant is weird

CKoha fullscreen combo

heres a full recording of the probably close to opimal fullscreen corner to corner combo
+ my execution ASMR

basically that long ass combo with the stupid execution requirements gives you the most consistent knockdowns
you need lots of weird delays to get the easier versions of the combo to knock down at all ranges

if you actually want to go and be practical and play matches as CKoha
[1:12 AM]
just stick to getting that first 2C knockdown from the first route i posted
[1:12 AM]
and just do midscreen pressure
[1:13 AM]
the closer you are to the corner, the easier it gets
[1:13 AM]
because you can do 5C~C(4) 236[B] and then either 2A 2C or 5A 5C 5[B] 2B 2C
[1:13 AM]
again, paradoxically, the harder route gives easier knockdowns
```


```
you land
[1:24 AM]
and do 66 2C 5C~C(4) 236[B]~B 2C
[1:25 AM]
you need to manually time the gap between the 5C and the followup ~C
[1:25 AM]
there should be a bit of a delay there
[1:25 AM]
and then time the final 2C
