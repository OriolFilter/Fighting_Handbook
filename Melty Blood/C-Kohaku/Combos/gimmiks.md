**214A** recovers in the air (with or without previous molotov), so you can actually do **j.a** while falling, based on this we can take multiple variations (which unsure if are viable or the idea itself is)

- **214A (x)** 
  - **214A (x) j.a > (corner combo)**
  - **214A (x) 214A/C > ?(corner combo)**
  - **214A (x) 214[B] > ?(corner combo)**
