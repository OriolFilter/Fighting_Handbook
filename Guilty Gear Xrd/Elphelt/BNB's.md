# BASIC HITCONFIRMS

> 5k > (c.s) > f.s > 5h > 214k - Basic hitconfirm in close range. 93 damage with c.s, 80 without

> 5k > (c.s) > f.s > 5hx5 - For medium range when c.s doesn’t come out. At this range 214k might not hit every time on every character, so you want to use 5hx5. 5h whiffs on crouchers, so if your  opponent is crouching, use the next combo. 100 damage with c.s, 89 without

> 5k > (c.s) > f.s > 2h > 2d > 214k - 2h is an excellent normal for crouch confirms since it will always combo after f.s if your opponent is crouching. 120 damage with c.s, 110 without

# BASIC PUNISHES

> c.s > f.s > 2s > 5hx5 OR 5h > 214k - For moves that are massively negative on block and leave the opponent standing. Combo begins with a running start. 127 damage/117 damage

> c.s > f.s > 2h > 2d > 214k - Mostly reserved for Sol’s Volcanic/Grand Viper since these end with him in the crouching state. Remove the c.s from this combo if the punish starts with a standing counterhit, or refer to the counter hit confirms section. 136 damage

# COUNTER HIT CONFIRMS

> This is where things get a little complicated. This will assume that you are familiar with the basics of Elphelt’s combo game and using stances, and that you’re ready to move on.

> F.s > 2h > 2d > 214k - Basic counter hit confirm. F.s does a huge amount of hitstun on counter hit, so 2h will always combo afterwards if you’re in range. If you’re close enough on the first hit of 2h, you can combo into a 2d pickup on some characters; listed lower down in the guide. 123 damage

> F.s > Instant Air Dash > j.s > j.h > land > c.s > f.s > 5h > 214k - A bit more complicated than the basic punish and reserved exclusively for standing opponents at far slash’s maximum range. Far slash does obscene amounts of hitstun on counter hit so knowing how to press with IAD can be useful. 153 damage

> 6h > 236p > 5k > c.s > jump > j.ksh > toss > 6h > 236h > sg-s > 236h > c.s > jump > j.spshd/j.kshd > 236p - Watch when you’re throwing out 6h’s, since the reward for counter hits is very large. This is assuming that 6h lands at max range, so 5k is used to give the opponent a height boost after running up. If the opponent is high up when the sg-s connects, it’s easier to get the knockdown with the second air combo. It doesn’t matter which one you use because the damage is identical. 172 damage

> 6h > 236h > sg-s > 236h > c.s > jump > j.sps > double jump > j.spshd > 236p - Easy 6h counter confirm. Leads to knockdown and grenade oki. Works on characters with awkward hitboxes like Johnny more consistently than the previous combo. 160 damage

> 2h > 236p > c.s > jump > j.s > double jump >  j.ksh > toss > 6h > 236h > sg-s >236h > c.s > jump > j.spshd/j.kshd > 236p - 2h is another normal that provides insane reward on counter hit, but you should probably be throwing out random 2h in neutral less than 6h unless you know what you’re doing. 178 damage

# CLOSE SLASH ANTI-AIR CONFIRMS

> Close Slash is Elphelt’s best and most reliable anti-air. It’s an excellent tool for taking out opponents that are hanging around right above or immediately in front of you, as well as option selecting opponents trying to jump out of your pressure.

> C.s > jump > j.sps > double jump > j.spshd > 236p - Basic anti-air confirm into knockdown and grenade oki. Easy, useful, good damage. Know this combo. 142 damage

> Counter Hit c.s > delay > 2h > 236p > c.s > jump > j.s > double jump > j.ksh > toss > 6h > 236h > sg-s >236h > c.s > j.kshd > 236p - Counter hit anti-air confirm, extremely situational, but you could react to the c.s counter hit. 197 damage

# METERED CONVERSION

> EDIT: This combo causes a lot of questions in the discord, so before I start, I feel it is worth mentioning that the key to landing this combo is to delay between buttons in the j.s > dj > j.ksh sequence properly to keep the opponent at a higher elevation than you before you toss the grenade. This may need to be adjusted per character but once you understand the theory you should be good.

> If you’re going to do conversions with 50 meter, be sure that there aren’t too many hits in your combo beforehand; otherwise the combo will likely fail due to how the game treats hitstun and gravity in long combos. For the sake of simplicity, we’re going to start with c.s > f.s > 2d > 214k. This combo will also work after roman cancelling a throw/air throw. There’s only one combo listed here, and it’s because it’s the only one worth doing unless you just want to do a standard anti-air combo after the cancel or you’re in the corner and want shotgun loops.

> c.s > f.s > 2d > 214k > RRC > 2h > 236p > c.s > jump > j.s > double jump > j.ksh > toss > 6h > 236h > sg-s > 236h > c.s > j.kshd > 236p - High damage 50 tension confirm. Bread and butter extended Elphelt combo. 199 damage

# 2D PICKUPS

> If you are close enough to some characters while doing 2d, it’s possible to pick them up off the ground mid-combo and continue into the air. The following routes come from combos that start with c.s > f.s > 2h(2) > 2d and have a running start. To make them easier, you can do 2h(1). If further away, the combo has to be 2D j.pkpps > double jump j.kshd or some variation of it. But the most important part being that j.pk confirms into full combo from further away than any other variation of pick up after 2D.

> May, Potemkin, Chipp, Haehyun*: c.s > f.s > 2h(2) > 2d > j.ksps > double jump > j.spshd

> Millia: c.s > f.s > 2h(2) > 2d > j.psps > double jump > j.spshd

> Faust: c.s > f.s > 2h(2) > 2d >  j.spsps > double jump > j.spshd

> Johnny, Jack-O’: c.s > f.s > 2h(2) > 2d > j.pksps > double jump > j.spshd

> *Haehyun must be picked up after the first hit of 2h, it will not connect if you do the second

# 2H RELAUNCHES

> Elphelt has the ability to use 2h to extend her combos after doing an air combo ending in j.d. If you can carefully delay your hits so that the enemy hits the upper part of j.d’s hitbox, you’ll have a lot of time to hit the ground and do 2h while they’re floating. Note that relaunch combos are significantly easier on lighter characters than heavyweights, but they can be done on heavyweights. An example would be something like this:

> Anti-air c.s > jump > j.s > double jump > j.kshd > 2h > c.s > jump > j.s > double jump > j.kshd > 236p - 193 damage

> Anti-air c.s > jump > j.s > double jump > j.kshd > 2h > 236p > c.s > j.7h > toss - 171 damage

> Anti-air c.s > jump > j.s > double jump > j.kshd > 2h > 236p > c.s > jump > j.s > double jump > j.ksh > toss > 6h > 236h > sg-s > 214k > 3xsg-h - Incorporates bread and butter grenade combo. Tested on Sol, likely doesn’t work on every character. 205 damage

# SHOTGUN LOOPS

> Shotgun loops are an extremely important part of maximizing your damage. While in shotgun stance, if you stand still for a few frames, Elphelt will flash and sight the shotgun. Pressing sg-h while charged will fire a much more powerful version that will do about 9% of guts-ignoring chip damage(!) to your opponent and shred a lot of their tension if they used faultless defense. It’s also +5 on block, so it can be used for pressuring and frametraps.
If you use charged sg-h in the corner at a close enough range, it will wallstick your opponent. You can then follow up with more sg-h’s and combo into a knockdown. You can combo into shotgun loops from roman cancels or counter hit heavy normals near the corner. Walking forward between shots will also give you a bit more damage by increasing the number of loops you can perform. You could also get shotgun loops from sg-d, your command grab. Some examples would be

> C.s > f.s > 2d > 214k > rrc > run forward 236h > (wait for charge) > 4x charged sg-h > dash forward jump > j.spshd > 236p - 50 tension conversion for if you’d rather finish off the opponent or just do a bunch of damage instead of going for an unblockable near the corner. 223 damage

> Sg-d > 236p > (wait for charge) > sg-s > 2x charged sg-h > sg-s > toss > (wait for charge) > sg-s > 5x charged sg-h - Very high damage command grab combo. 163 damage
