Beginner Combos
Combos for players very new to Bullet. These are easy to use and easy to remember. Don’t be afraid to experiment and try out other routes as you get more comfortable.

### (2A) > 2B > (5B) > 5C > 2C > 214D
Video Example
Damage: 1345
Day 1 Combo. Gives you a Heat Level. In mission mode, it tells you to do 2C(1) for a basic BnB. Don’t do this, using both hits of 2C is much easier.

### 6B > jc > j.C > djc > j.C > j.D > 623B
Video Example
Damage: 2104
Basic anti air combo. This combo will teach you special cancels from drive. Mission mode is helpful for examples. Keep in mind that you have to wait until Bullet hits the ground before completing the input for a special move. This gives you a Heat Level with better knockdown.

### Back Throw > 236[A] > 5B > 6B > sjc > j.C > djc > j.C > j.D > 623B
Video Example
Damage: 2740
Basic Back Throw combo. You have a lot of time to buffer 236[A].

### Forward Throw > dash 5B > 6B > sjc > j.C > djc > j.C > j.D > 623B
Video Example
Damage: 2554
Basic forward throw combo. Similar to the back throw combo.

### 5B > 5C > 2C > 623B > 22D > (66) > 6C > jc > j.D > 623B
Video Example
Requires: H2
Damage: 3305
Basic H2 confirm. The dash is optional depending on your stage positioning. Try it out in different places and experiment with little adjustments.
