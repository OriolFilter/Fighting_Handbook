## Safejumps

In CF, Cutting Sheer no longer gives guaranteed untechable knockdown and in longer combos will cause opponents to air tech before hitting the ground. As a result, you won't always be using Cutting Shear as an ender. Thankfully, it still leads into Bullet's safejump. After Sheer, input 9A > 4j.C. This will safe jump against most reversals in the game, beat mashing, and force your opponent to block on emergency tech. Be wary, though, because this loses to rolls and delay wakeups.
